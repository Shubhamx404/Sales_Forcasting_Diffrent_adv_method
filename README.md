# Time Series Regression Model
**Sales Forcasting  WIth Time series analysis**
**developed a sales forecasting system using Time Series and Causal Models, effectively predicting trends and external impacts on product sales.**
     Primary task : __Perform time series analysis to understand the data and trends__
                    Use multiple forecasting models on sales dataset


## Project Overview

This project involves building a regression model to predict sales data over time. The dataset includes sales data from various stores and items over a specified period. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately forecast future sales based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- **date**: The date of the sales record.
- **store**: The store identifier.
- **item**: The item identifier.
- **sales**: The number of sales.
- **f0**: Feature 0 (additional feature, if any).
- **f1**: Feature 1 (additional feature, if any).

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and to convert the date column to a datetime format.
